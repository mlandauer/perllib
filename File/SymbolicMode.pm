File::SymbolicMode

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Function to interpret chmod(1)-style symbolic file modes.

=head1 FUNCTIONS

=over 4

=item symbolic_mode MODE TEXT

Apply to the pre-existing file MODE the permissions changes described by TEXT,
which is a chmod(1)-style symbolic permissions description (e.g.,
"u=rwx,g=r,o-rwx" represents 0740). Returns undef if the string is not a valid
symbolic mode. Does not honour the process's current umask.

    #
    # The syntax is defined here:
    #   http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/utilities/chmod.html
    # This function is trivially derived from one in,
    #   http://ppt.perl.org/commands/chmod/SymbolicMode.pm
    # but that version is not separately packaged and only operates on files,
    # whereas we want one which operated on mode integers. It also honours the
    # umask, whereas we do not.

    # Initialization.
    # The 'user', 'group' and 'other' groups.

    # and others, and a group for the special flags, but they are really 3
    # groups of 4 bits. Or maybe not. 
    #
    # Anyway, this function is greatly simplified by treating them as 3 4-bit
    # groups. The highest bit will be "special" one. suid for the users group,
    # guid for the group group, and the sticky bit for the others group.
