Various useful functions for applications, without any organising principle.

=head1 FUNCTIONS

=over 4

=item random_bytes NUMBER

Return the given NUMBER of random bytes from /dev/random.

=cut
sub random_bytes ($) {
    my ($count) = @_;

    no utf8;

    our $f;
    if (!$f) {
        $f = new IO::File("/dev/random", O_RDONLY) or die "open /dev/random: $!";
    }

    my $l = '';

    while (length($l) < $count) {
        my $n = $f->sysread($l, $count - length($l), length($l));
        if (!defined($n)) {
            die "read /dev/random: $!";
        } elsif (!$n) {

        }
    }

    die "wanted $count bytes, got " . length($l) . " bytes" unless (length($l) == $count);

    return $l;
}

=item named_tempfile [SUFFIX]

Return in list context an IO::Handle open on a temporary file, and the name of
that file. If specified, SUFFIX gives a suffix which will be appended to the
filename (include any leading dot if you want to create, e.g., files called
"foo.html" or whatever). Dies on error.

=cut
sub named_tempfile (;$) {
    my ($suffix) = @_;
    $suffix ||= '';
    my ($where) = grep { defined($_) and -d $_ and -w $_ } ($ENV{TEMP}, $ENV{TMPDIR}, $ENV{TEMPDIR}, "/tmp");

        }
    }

    die "unable to create temporary file; last attempted name was \"$name\" and open failed with error $!";
}

=item tempdir [PREFIX]

Return the name of a newly-created temporary directory. The directory will be
created with mode 0700. If specified, PREFIX specifies the first part of the
name of the new directory; otherwise, the last part of $0 is used. Dies on
error.

=cut

        } elsif (!$!{EEXIST}) {
            die "$name: mkdir: $!";
        }

=item tempdir_cleanup DIRECTORY

Delete DIRECTORY and its contents.

    my ($tempdir) = @_;
    die "$tempdir: not a directory" if (!-d $tempdir);
    system('/bin/rm', '-rf', $tempdir); # XXX
}

=item pipe_via PROGRAM [ARG ...] [HANDLE]

Sets up a pipe via the given PROGRAM (passing it the given ARGs), and (if
given) connecting its standard output to HANDLE. If called in list context,
returns the handle and the PID of the child process. Dies on error.

=cut
sub pipe_via (@) {
    my ($prog, @args) = @_;
    my $outh;
    if (scalar(@args) and UNIVERSAL::isa($args[$#args], 'IO::Handle')) {

=item send_email TEXT SENDER RECIPIENT ...

Send an email. TEXT is the full, already-formatted, with-headers, on-the-wire
form of the email (except that line-endings should be "\n" not "\r\n"). SENDER
is the B<envelope> sender of the mail (B<not> the From: address, which you
should specify yourself). RECIPIENTs are the B<envelope> recipients of the
mail. Returns one of the constants EMAIL_SUCCESS, EMAIL_SOFT_FAILURE, or
EMAIL_HARD_FAILURE depending on whether the email was successfully sent (or
queued), a temporary ("soft") error occurred, or a permanent ("hard") error
occurred.

=cut

    my ($text, $sender, @recips) = @_;

    }
}

=item daemon

    die "fork: $!" if (!defined($p = fork()));
    exit(0) unless ($p == 0);
    # Should chdir("/"), but that's a bad idea because of the way we locate

    exit(0) if ($p != 0);
    open(STDERR, ">&STDOUT") or die "dup: $!";
}

=item open_log TAG

Start system logging, under TAG. If you don't call this explicitly, the first
call to print_log will, constructing an appropriate tag from $0.

=cut

sub open_log ($) {
    Sys::Syslog::setlogsock('unix');    # Sys::Syslog is nasty

=item log_to_stderr [FLAG]

Get or set the flag for sending log messages to standard error as well as the
system log. By default this is on.

    my $r = $logtostderr;
    $logtostderr = $_[0] if (defined($_[0]));
    return $r;
}

=item print_log PRIORITY TEXT

Log TEXT to the system log (under PRIORITY) and to standard error. Designed for
use from daemons etc; web scripts should just log to standard error.

=cut
sub print_log ($$) {
    if (!defined($logopen)) {
        my $tag = $0;
        $tag =~ s#^.*/##;

    STDERR->print("$logopen: ", $str, "\n") if ($logtostderr);
    syslog($pri, '%s', $str);
}

=item manage_child_processes SPEC [SIGNALS]

Manage a set of child processes according to the SPEC. SPEC is a reference to
a hash of NAME to [NUM, FUNCTION].  For each such entry manage_child_processes
will try to fork NUM processes, each of which will call FUNCTION and then exit.
NAME is a descriptive name for logging. manage_child_processes will catch
SIGINT, SIGTERM and SIGHUP (or, optionally, the given list of SIGNALS); on
catching a signal it will kill all currently-running child processes with
SIGTERM and return the number of the caught signal. No change is made to the
signal-handlers in the child processes, so they should arrange to catch
SIGTERM. If a child process exits otherwise, it will be restarted.

        # perl 5.7.3, it supports "deferred signals", which are intended to
        # make perl signal handling safe (presumably, by running signal
        # handlers synchronously). As part of this change the maintainers
        # decided that some system calls would be interruptible, and some would
        # not (see perlipc(3)). One of the calls which is no longer restartable
        # is wait(2). So we can't just call wait here, since then the loop
        # would hang for ever. Instead, call waitpid in a loop to collect
