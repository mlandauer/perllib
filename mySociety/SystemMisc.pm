Become a daemon.

    open(STDERR, ">&STDOUT") or die "dup: $!";
}

=item open_log TAG

Start system logging, under TAG. If you don't call this explicitly, the first
call to print_log will, constructing an appropriate tag from $0.

=cut
my ($logopen, $savedlogtag, $triedconnect);
sub open_log ($) {
    # Wrap the openlog call in eval because it will fail if it can't connect
    # to /dev/log (god alone knows why -- it's a datagram socket, so they could
    # just use sendto). It's possible (though unlikely) that the connection
    # could fail, but this doesn't matter because we'd just call openlog again
    # on the next invocation of print_log. However, openlog's default behaviour
    # is to die if connect fails.
    $savedlogtag ||= $_[0];
    my $w;
    eval {
        $SIG{__WARN__} = sub { $w = $_[0] };
        Sys::Syslog::setlogsock('unix');    # Sys::Syslog is nasty
        openlog($_[0], 'pid,ndelay', 'daemon');
        $logopen = $_[0];
    };

        print STDERR "$_[0]: open_log: $w";
        print STDERR "$_[0]: that means that errors will not be logged to the system log, at least until we're able to connect to /dev/log\n";
        $triedconnect = 1;
    }
}

=item log_to_stderr [FLAG]

Get or set the flag for sending log messages to standard error as well as the
system log. By default this is on.

=cut
my $logtostderr = 1;
sub log_to_stderr (;$) {
    my $r = $logtostderr;
    $logtostderr = $_[0] if (defined($_[0]));
    return $r;
}

=item print_log PRIORITY TEXT

=item printf_log PRIORITY FORMAT [ARGUMENT ...]

Log TEXT to the system log (under PRIORITY) and to standard error. Designed for
use from daemons etc; web scripts should just log to standard error. printf_log
is the printf(3) analogue.

=cut
sub print_log ($$) {
    my $tag = $logopen;
    if (!defined($tag)) {
        $tag = $savedlogtag;
        if (!$tag) {

    # Log to standard error if either we have been told to explicitly, or we
    # have not been able to open the log.
    STDERR->print("$tag: ", $str, "\n") if ($logtostderr || ($triedconnect && !$logopen));

    my $pri = shift;
    my $fmt = shift;
    my $str = sprintf($fmt, @_);
    print_log($pri, $str);
}

=item manage_child_processes SPEC [SIGNALS]

Manage a set of child processes according to the SPEC. SPEC is a reference to
a hash of NAME to [NUM, FUNCTION].  For each such entry manage_child_processes
will try to fork NUM processes, each of which will call FUNCTION and then exit.
NAME is a descriptive name for logging. manage_child_processes will catch
SIGINT, SIGTERM and SIGHUP (or, optionally, the given list of SIGNALS); on
catching a signal it will kill all currently-running child processes with
SIGTERM and return the number of the caught signal. No change is made to the
signal-handlers in the child processes, so they should arrange to catch
SIGTERM. If a child process exits otherwise, it will be restarted.

=cut

        # Why can't we just call waitpid here? Well, in perl < 5.7.3, we could.
        # Previously perl had the usual behaviour over signals: arrival of a
        # signal would cause system calls to return with EINTR. However, since
        # perl 5.7.3, it supports "deferred signals", which are intended to
        # make perl signal handling safe (presumably, by running signal
        # handlers synchronously). As part of this change the maintainers
        # decided that some system calls would be interruptible, and some would
        # not (see perlipc(3)). One of the calls which is no longer restartable
        # is wait(2). So we can't just call wait here, since then the loop
        # would hang for ever. Instead, call waitpid in a loop to collect
        # expired children, and then sleep. Hopefully, signals will interrupt

=item kill_named_processes SIGNAL PGREP_PARAMS

Sends signal SIGNAL to all processes which pgrep(1) matches. PGREP_PARAMS is
the extra parameters for pgrep and will be passed to the shell, so must be
escaped. Parameters to limit pgrep to processes owned by the owner of 
the current process are added to the call to pgrep.

e.g. kill_named_processes(SIGTERM, '"^ref-sign.cgi$"')

    kill $signal, @pids;
}

=item shell COMMAND PARAMS...

Execute given command using "system", and check for an error. If there
is an error, die with useful diagnostics.

=cut

    }
}


=item describe_waitval VALUE [FUNCTION]

Given VALUE, returned by one of the wait syscalls or system, return undef if
it indicates a successful, normal exit, or a string describing the error
encountered. This will be one of,

=over 4

=item FUNCTION: ERROR

if the system call itself failed;

=item killed by signal NUMBER

if the process was killed by a signal; or

=item exited with status STATUS

if the process exited with a nonzero exit status.

=back

FUNCTION should specify the name of the function which returned VALUE. It
defaults to "wait".
