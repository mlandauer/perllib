mySociety::DBHandle

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Common functionality for shared database handles.

=head1 FUNCTIONS

=over 4

=item configure KEY VALUE ...

Configure database access. Must be called before dbh() or newdbh(). Allowed
keys are,

=over 4

=item Name

database name (required);

=item User

Database username (required);

=item Password

database password;

=item Host

host on which to contact database server;

=item Port

port on which to contact database server;

=item OnFirstUse

reference to code to be executed after the first connection to the database is
made.

=back

A key whose value is not defined is treated as if it were not present.

Return a new handle open on the database.

Return a shared database handle.
